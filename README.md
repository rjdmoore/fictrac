**FicTrac** is an open source software library and set of executables for reconstructing the fictive path of an animal walking on a patterned sphere. The software is fast, flexible, and easy to use and simplifies the setup of closed-loop tracking experiments.

FicTrac was originally developed by researchers at the [Queensland Brain Institute](http://qbi.uq.edu.au/) at the University of Queensland, Australia for tracking honeybees and fruit flies during closed-loop tethered walking experiments, but it has since proved useful for tracking a wide range of animals with different movement speeds, tracking ball diameters and patterns, and visual stimuli.
